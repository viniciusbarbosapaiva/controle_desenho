# Project Title

Automation of the Distribution Control of Engineering Drawings.

## Description

According to the ISO 9001 standard, document control and review is a very important process for any company that seeks continuous improvement. In order to meet this, the Surco Engineering sector is responsible for controlling the drawings distributed for the manufacture and assembly of equipment sold to the various clients in the Oil and Gas sector. However, this process demands a lot of time from the responsible professional. Aiming at procedural optimization, the control task was all automated from start to finish by consulting a data source, where, in a way, all drawings are controlled without human interference.

* datetime
* PysimpleGUI
* json
* os

* plattaforms

### Project Results 

Before automation, a qualified professional was needed to perform the task of controlling the distribution of drawings for manufacturing and assembly of equipment. However, after automation, there is no need for a professional performing this function. Thus minimizing the cost of qualified labor and made it possible to allocate the professional to other tasks.
