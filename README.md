# Project Title

Automation of the Engineering Drawings Printing Process.

## Description

It is the responsibility of the Surco Engineering sector to print drawings for the manufacture and assembly of equipment sold to various clients in the Oil and Gas sector. However, this process demands a lot of time from the responsible professional. Aiming at process optimization, the entire printing task was automated from start to finish by consulting a data source, where, in a way, all drawings are printed for all sectors without human interference.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* numpy
* pandas
* datetime
* PysimpleGUI
* json
* os
* pysutogui
* time
* subprocess

### Project Results 

Before automation, a qualified professional was needed to perform the task of printing drawings for the manufacturing and assembly of equipment. However, after automation, there is no need for a professional performing this function. Thus, it minimized the cost of qualified labor and allowed the professional to be allocated to other tasks.
